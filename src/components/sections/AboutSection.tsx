            <p className="mb-4 dark:text-gray-300">
              Founded by Savio Soares in 2003, our company specializes in discovering exceptional wines from family-owned estates that honor traditional winemaking methods and deeply respect their terroir.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 dark:text-gray-300">
              We believe that the finest wines tell a storyâ€”one that reflects their origin, the dedication of their producers, and the cultural heritage behind each bottle. Our portfolio represents a carefully curated selection of wines that embody these values.
            </p>
            <p className="dark:text-gray-300">
              Every producer in our portfolio shares our commitment to sustainable agriculture and minimal intervention winemaking, ensuring that each wine authentically expresses its unique character.
